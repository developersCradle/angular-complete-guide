# What I Learned

- Angular for single page application
- AngularJS(Angular 1) was with flaws. **Should not be using if can**
- Main big change is between **Angular 1** and **Angular 2**
- Angular 2 -> Angular 12... can be called **Angular**

- Angular CLI official one
    - Recomended to create Angular project
    - Good with optimization to code in browser

- NodeJs needs to behind scenes to bundle and optimize Angular
    - We also need **npm** tool from NodeJS


### Setting angular project first time
1. Downloading AngularCLI `npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`
2. `ng new my-first-app --no-strict`
    - after `new` project name
    - `--no-strict` no strict strict mode, for now 
3. ` Would you like to add Angular routing? (y/N)` no for now
4. `Which stylesheet format would you like to use? ` CSS

- We need to do this stuff for typeSript

5. `ng serve` Run development server
    - `ctlr + c` to stop process
`package.json` describes dependencies
    - `node_modules` is folder for these dependency binaryes
